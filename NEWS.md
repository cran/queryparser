* Output indicates when queries aggregate
  * List returned by `parse_query()` has attribute `aggregate` set to `TRUE` if query aggregates ([#8](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser/issues/8))
  * When translating an aggregate query, sublist `select` returned by by `parse_query()` has logical vector attribute `aggregate` indicating whether each expression in the `SELECT` list aggregates ([#9](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser/issues/9))
  * When translating an aggregate query with an `ORDER BY` clause, sublist `order_by` returned by by `parse_query()` has logical vector attribute `aggregate` indicating whether each expression in the `ORDER BY` clause aggregates ([#11](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser/issues/11))
* Translation of multiple `CAST` and `BETWEEN` expressions in a single expression no longer fails  ([#10](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser/issues/10))
